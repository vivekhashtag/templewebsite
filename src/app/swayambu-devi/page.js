            <p>
              From time immemorial, the Supreme Mother has existed as Maha
              Sakthi, with neither beginning nor end. She bestowed a divine form
              upon Aadhi Sivan (Lord Shiva), and together, they brought about
              the rebirth of all the worlds. At Her command, the Devas and the
              Trimurthies took charge of these worlds, establishing Her as the
              very first and highest of all that exists.{" "}
              <strong>Thiruvadisoolam</strong> : Where Devi‚Äôs Holy Footprints
              Remain Long before the yugas (ages) began, Aadhi Sakthi and Lord
              Shiva created this world, Earth. During that time, She chose a
              special sacred spot for Herself by leaving an impression of{" "}
              <strong>Her Holy Feet</strong> and marking it with Her
              three-leaf-adorned Trishul. In later times, this revered place
              became known as Thiruvadisoolam.

              In a profound display of divine play (Leela), Devi manifested at
              Thiruvadisoolam, revealing Her cosmic form as the guardian of this
              era and affirming Her sacred presence. During the excavation for
              Devi‚Äôs sanctum‚Äîdestined to support the towering Mahalingam‚Äîwater
              from the hidden Vegavathi River miraculously surged forth, mingled
              with blood. From this sacred phenomenon, Swayambu Devi emerged in
              the form of{" "}
              <strong className="text-amber-400">
                Shiva-Shakti Linga, marked by three golden lines
              </strong>
              . This awe-inspiring vision was witnessed by devoted souls present
              on that significant day, 28th January 2018 (Sunday).
            </p>

            <p>
              This moment became a living testament to Devi‚Äôs divine essence‚Äîthe
              animating life force of all creation. She sanctified this sacred
              ground with Her Holy Feet, blessing it as a powerful spiritual
              epicenter that continues to bestow abundance, prosperity, and
              grace upon all who seek Her.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a similar divine occurrence, Devi Mookambika manifested as
              Swayambu with golden lines for Sri Adi Shankaracharya, along the
              banks of the river Souparnika, bestowing Her grace upon the world.
              Even in today‚Äôs times, we continue to witness Devi revealing Her
              eternal presence in the very places sanctified by Her divine
              footprints.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through these manifestations, the Devi&apos;s timeless energy
