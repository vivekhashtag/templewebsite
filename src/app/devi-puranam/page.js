          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
            <p>
              Alarmed by the intensity of Kali Yuga, the Devas, Saints, and
              Yogis sought the guidance of the Supreme Mother. In response, Devi
              Karumaari promised to manifest and protect humanity through Her
              chosen messengers, the Arulalars. Before descending to Earth, She
              received the sacred sceptre from Lord Shiva and embraced the five
              divine rolesâ€”creation, protection, destruction, concealment, and
              the bestowal of graceâ€”thus beginning Her holy mission for Kali
              Yuga.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fulfilling Her promise to the Devas, Devi claimed these five roles
              as Her own and sought a sacred vow from Her divine brother, Lord
              Sriman Narayanan. He pledged to manifest His divine presence in
              Her Aadhi Thiruvadi Kshetra (Thiruvadisoolam) after His earthly
              incarnations in Kali Yuga, vowing to stand beside Her in His
              Aachaavathara forms (the Dasa Avatars), blessing all who seek Her
              with infinite grace and prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>
              During Her celestial travels, Devi (Parapaarai) visited Surya Loka
              and chastised Lord Surya for failing to recognize Her Kali Yuga
              incarnation. Moved by His sincere plea for forgiveness, She
              softened and blessed Him with a divine boonâ€”that She would
              manifest Her sacred presence on His day, Sunday, as Devi Maari of
              Kali Yuga.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Her journey to Yamaloka, Devi encountered Lord Yama, who too
              failed to recognize Her divine form cloaked in the darkness of
              Kali Yuga. To humble his pride, She reclaimed the Trishul and the
              Death Rope once entrusted to him. In Her infinite compassion, She
              also bestowed a blessing: that Her devotees would be beyond
              Yama&apos; s reach unless She Herself granted permission.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon arriving on Earth, Devi incarnated through a celestial maiden
              (Saptha Kanni) in southern Tamil Nadu to help humanity recognize
              Her divine essence. Though initially blessed with prosperity, the
              maiden became entangled in the illusions of Maya, forgetting her
              divine purpose. Her family fell into poverty, and she struggled to
              care for her five children in the humble village of
              Pazhanthandalam. In an act of divine compassion, Devi transformed
              into a black serpent and struck the maiden, leading to her passing
              on a Friday in the Tamil month of Thai.
            </p>
            <p>
              As cremation rites began, Devi appeared in the form of a frail,
              radiant elderly woman. She illuminated the funeral ground with Her
              divine light and removed the maidenâ€™s body. Then, reappearing as a
              celestial maiden glowing with inner brilliance, She manifested
              fully on that Sunday eveningâ€”marking the first revelation of Devi
              Karumaari and bestowing upon Herself the sacred name Karumaari.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that very spot, Devi made a powerful vow: &quot;I shall bless
              humanity for twenty-one generations through yogis who meditate and
              worship Me in the Srividhya tradition.&quot; To fulfill this
              promise, She incarnated yogis to walk among mortals. She guided
              Sri Paalaiyakumaran Swamigal to the Sri Ellai Kali Amman Temple
              near the Arulmigu Vedapureeswarar Temple in Vada Thirumaraikadu
              (Thiruverkadu), where She again manifested Her divine presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Devi then embarked on a divine journey to bless various sacred
              sites. She chose Sri Thambu Swamigal to enact Her divine
              Leelaâ€”reviving the deceased daughter of Sri Poovai Vaiyapuri
              Mudalaiyar. To convey Her sacred words (Arul Vakku), Devi
              instructed Sri Thambu Swamigal to establish a Sakthi Peedam, which
              eventually became the renowned Sri Devi Karumaari Devasthanam.
